#Recruiting Business Developement's best friend
Given the desired job titles:
  * looks up active job postings on LinkedIn
  * identifies the job poster (usually HR)
  * attempts to identify the direct hiring manager
  * uses ZoomInfo to pull relevant contact info
  * End result is an epic spreadsheet for tomorrow's BD calls

It's gonna get messy. This is my first attempt at a program.
